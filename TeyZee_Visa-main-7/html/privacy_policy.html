<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">Privacy Policy</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">As a registered member of Teyzee Visas, you will be entitled to savings and benefits on airfares, hotel reservations, and car rentals, among other travel services. In addition, look forward to receiving monthly newsletters and exclusive promotions offering special deals. <br> That's why we've provided this Privacy Policy, which sets forth our policies regarding the collection, use, and protection of the personal information of those using the teyzeevisas.com website.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Personal information means information that can be linked to a specific individual, such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and credit card number. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy and become familiar with it, but you should know that we do not sell or rent our customers' personal information to third parties.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Please note that we review our Privacy Policy from time to time and may make periodic changes to the policy in connection with that review. Therefore, you may wish to bookmark this page and/or periodically review this page to make sure you have the latest version. <br> Regardless of later updates, we will abide by the privacy practices described to you in this Privacy Policy at the time you provided us with your personal information.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">This Privacy Policy Explains the Following:</p> <br>
What personal information we collect from you and how we use it <br>
When browsing our site, you are required to log on with your login ID and password provided by your administration staff or by staff of Kall Trip Pvt Ltd. <br>

<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">Member Profile</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">As a Teyzee Visas site member, administration staff can choose to complete a traveler’s online profile by providing us with travel preferences, frequent-traveler or affinity numbers, credit card billing information, and other personal information. This information is primarily used to assist you in making reservations quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">To purchase travel and/or related services through our site, users must provide personal information such as your name, Payment Method (Credit/Advance Float) or credit card number and expiration date, credit card billing address, date of birth (in case of child), telephone number, e-mail address, and the name(s) of the person(s) traveling. We may also ask for other personal information, such as frequent traveler numbers. <br> We require this information to share with service providers like airlines, hotels, etc., to process, fulfill and confirm your reservations and transactions and keep you informed of each transaction’s status.If you are making a reservation for one or more travelers other than yourself, you must confirm and represent that each of these other travelers have agreed, in advance, that you may disclose their personal information to us.</p><br>

<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">Automatic Logging of Session Data</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">We automatically log generic information about your computer’s connection to the Internet, which we call "session data," that is anonymous and not linked to any personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system, browser type, and the activities conducted by the user while on the Teyzee Visas website.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">An IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the internet, such as our web servers, know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data to analyze which items visitors click on most, how they navigate the site, how many pages are visited, how long they stay, and how often they return. It also helps us diagnose server issues and improve system administration.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Although this information does not identify any visitor personally, it is possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the approximate geographic location of their connection point.</p>
<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">With whom (if anyone) your personal information is shared</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">When you reserve or purchase travel services through Teyzee Visas Pvt. Ltd., we must provide some of your personal information to the airline, hotel, car rental agency, travel agency, or other third party involved in fulfilling your travel arrangements.</p> <br>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">However, we do not sell or trade individual customer names or other personal information to third parties without the user’s consent. Teyzee Visas uses non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build better, more useful online services by performing statistical analysis of customer and visitor behavior, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Teyzee Visas website. </p><br>

<div class="more-text">
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Information such as credit card and net banking details are generally collected directly by payment gateways and banks—not by Teyzee Visas. If any such information is stored or retained by us, it is shared only with government, statutory, or security agencies to screen for fraudulent activities and with third parties solely for the purpose of providing cashbacks, discounts, or processing chargebacks, if applicable.</p>
</div>

<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">What safeguards we have in place to protect your personal information?</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">All payments on the Teyzee Visas site are SSL secured. This means all personal information you provide to Teyzee Visas Pvt. Ltd. is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. The same process happens when you make travel purchases on the teyzeevisas.com site.</p>

<h3 style="padding-top: 10px;">What other information should I know about my privacy?</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">The Teyzee Visas site contains links to other websites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website for which Teyzee Visas Pvt. Ltd. has no responsibility. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of all such sites as their policies may be materially different from this Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<div class="more-text">
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Of course, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and your Teyzee Visas site membership account information. Please be very careful, responsible, and alert with this information, especially whenever you're online.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">The linked sites are not under the control of Teyzee Visas, and Teyzee Visas is not responsible for the contents of any linked site, including without limitation any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to a linked site. Teyzee Visas is not responsible for any form of transmission whatsoever received by the user from any linked site. <br> Teyzee Visas is providing these links to the user only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Teyzee Visas or the website of the linked sites or any association with their operators or owners, including their legal heirs or assigns.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Teyzee Visas is not responsible for any errors, omissions, or representations on any linked site. Teyzee Visas does not endorse any advertiser on any linked site in any manner. Users are requested to verify the accuracy of all information on their own before relying on such content.</p><br>


  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">In addition to the circumstances described above, Kall Trip Pvt. Ltd. may disclose Teyzee Visas site member information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by a government or law enforcement authority, or in the good faith belief that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable — including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Kall Trip Pvt. Ltd. or any of its affiliates, associates, employees, directors, or officers. <br> This also applies when there is reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when someone else could be harmed by such activities.</p>
</div>

<br>
<div class="more-text">
  <p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">Additionally, if Kall Trip Pvt. Ltd. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will most likely be transferred in connection with such acquisition.
</p><br>
</div>



<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">This policy is effective as of January 1, 2012. Any material changes in how Kall Trip Pvt. Ltd. uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Statement.</p>

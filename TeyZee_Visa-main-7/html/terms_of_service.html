All our products detailed on this website are sold subject to these Terms and Conditions, and the same shall govern the contract between us.

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">When you reserve or purchase travel services through teyzeevisas.com, we must provide certain of your personal information to the airline, hotel, car rental agency, travel agency, or other involved third party to enable the successful fulfilment of your travel arrangements.

However, in case a client is not satisfied with a particular service, we can take up the matter with the supplier if we are intimated immediately as per the process described in this document. <br>

<p style="text-align:justify; text-indent: 5%">As we book services in advance and are bound to honour the commitments as to payment to the suppliers, cancellation of services earmarked results in the Company losing money depending upon the time of communication of cancellation to the supplier, and therefore, the cancellation schedule, which is based on the above amongst other factors, becomes applicable on cancellation.</p>
